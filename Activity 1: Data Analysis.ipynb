For example, in the chart ranking by # of Crimes, Capitol Hill has the second-highest number of crimes, but in the chart ranking by Crime Rate, Georgetown has the second-highest crime rate. Capitol Hill, though it had a higher number of crimes, also had a relatively high population, meaning its crime rate was farther down the spectrum in the second chart. Meanwhile, Georgetown had a relatively small population and therefore a higher density of crimes for its population, meaning its crime rate was higher. \n",

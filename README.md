# Modeling Crime Data
Contributors: Hannah Jiang, instructed by Claudia Ludwig, Rachel Calder, Ellie Rider


Law enforcement services depend on technology to save lives. Analyzing crime data can reveal patterns among dates and locations, which emergency dispatchers rely on to assign emergency units and minimize response times. Using historical Seattle crime data, this project will use statistical and computational skills to determine when and where crimes occur the most in Seattle, in addition to why this could be happening and how we can predict crime rates in the future. There are three components to this activity, in addition to some of the topics we’ll cover in each:

- Data Analysis - What types of crime have been most prevalent? Where has the most crime occurred in the last 12 years? How has this changed over time? 
- Building a network - What causes crime? How do these causes relate and how can we visualize them?
- Machine Learning (optional) - How can we predict crimes rates in the future? How could we improve those predictions?

The Dataset we will be using is from Seattle GeoData’s Open Data Program and can be found <a href= "https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5" > here</a>. For this activity, the user should have Jupyter Notebook installed, since we’ll be using Python and popular packages such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, networkx, and scikit learn.

# Getting Started
To get started, the user must have Jupyter Notebook installed on their computer. If you don't already have it installed, I recommend using the <a href= "https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/"> Anaconda Platform</a>.

To download the datasets and notebook required for this project, click on the bright green "Code" button near the top of the page. When a dropdown menu pops up, click "Download ZIP." Extract the ZIP file in finder. Open Jupyter Notebook and go to the right side of your screen and hit "Upload," then navigate to the files in the folder. You can't directly upload a folder to Jupyter Notebook, so you'll have to select individual files and upload them.

The crime data we are using is too big to download from Github, so you will have to do it separately. Go to this <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ur28H0HOakYd3yemfq740txPr2kbWVAO/view?usp=sharing" > link</a>. It should lead you to a google drive file. Click "download" (you might get a popup that say "can't scan file for viruses," just hit "download anyways"). This should download the file to your computer. Go to Jupyter Notebook, click the "datasets" folder, hit "Upload," and navigate to that file. 

Your Notebook should look like <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jGYEpQS_EKkryO6zxYBBgS-5ak_liagf/view?usp=sharing" > this</a> when you're finished.

When you're ready, click the "Activity 1: Data Analysis" Notebook to begin this project!

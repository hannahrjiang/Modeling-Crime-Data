# Modeling Crime Data
Law enforcement services depend on technology to save lives. Analyzing crime data can reveal patterns among dates and locations, which emergency dispatchers rely on to assign emergency units and minimize response times. Using historical Seattle crime data, this project will use statistical and computational skills to determine and predict when and where crimes occur the most in Seattle, in addition to why this could be happening and how we can predict crime rates in the future. There are three components to this activity, in addition to some of the topics we’ll cover in each:

- Data Analysis - What types of crime have been most prevalent? Where has the most crime occurred in the last 12 years? How has this changed over time? 
- Building a network - What causes crime? How do these causes relate and how can we visualize them?
- Machine Learning- How can we predict crimes rates in the future? How could we improve those predictions?

The Dataset we will be using is from Seattle GeoData’s Open Data Program and can be found <a href= "https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5" > here</a>. For this activity, the user is required to have jupyter notebook installed, since we’ll also be using packages such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, networkx, and scikit learn.
To get started, you’ll also need the datasets in the "datasets" folder. Please download them to your computer.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve cited when, where, and what crimes occur, it’s time to determine why. By identifying some of the causes of crimes, officials can make efforts to prevent and predict future criminal activity. According to the <a href= \"https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2011/resources/variables-affecting-crime#:~:text=The%20transience%20of%20the%20population,and%20comprehending%20the%20crime%20issue.\" >FBI</a>, the variables affecting crime are as follows:\n",
    "- Population density \n",
    "- Degree of urbanization\n",
    "- Youth concentration of population\n",
    "- Family conditions\n",
    "- Median income\n",
    "- Poverty level\n",
    "- Employment\n",
    "- Education\n",
    "- Recreational characteristics\n",
    "- General health\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, we'll use data of the Seattle area to answer the following question:\n",
    "Do all these variables directly correlate with crime rates in Seattle? Do some correlate more than others? If so, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll create a network that can visualize the relationship between each of these factors and an area’s crime rate. We'll do this through combining them into a dataset along with an area's crime rate, then selecting certain variables that align to those above. Using the correlations between these variables, we'll draw and analyze a model using Cytoscape.\n",

    "- <h4> Crime Rate and Average Household Size: </h4> Crime rate and average household size have an R value of -0.56, meaning that for every decrease in average household size, there is an increase in crime rate (and vice versa). Areas with a high average household size generally have more than 1 or 2 people living in them, which indicates that a higher density of unified families live there. Living in a family setting generally discourages adults or youth from committing crimes, which is why the crime rate is generally low for these areas.\n",

This makes sense for the same reason as above- an area with a high youth concentration would tend to be more family-centered, which could discourage crime.\n",

    "    Not all of the variables above were directly correlated with crime in Seattle, but those that did were closely associated with population density, youth concentration, family conditions, and poverty level. However, this is not to say that the other variables did not affect crime rates in any way. Factors like poverty level are correlated to general health, employment, education, and income, which are correlated to recreational characteristics and urbanization. Though we’ve concluded that some variables are more closely related to crime than others, it’s important to remember that there are a lot of different factors that all share complex relations to each other. These relations all act together to alter an area’s crime rate.\n",
